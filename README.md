## My process

I started with adding all the HTML elements onto the page. Then, I started the mobile version and flexbox, and set the flex-direction to column.

When switching to Desktop, I added an extra div wrapper and changed the flex-direction of that wrapper to row. This was so that I could "attach" the image to the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned more about the position keyword, but I have still far to go when it comes to producing code that is compact and concise. I think that I could've figured out a shorter solution given more time, and would love to hear from others what I could've done to make the code more compact and shorter.

### Continued development

Continuing, I want to be able to make a nice page that has a nav bar and the site is functional and looks good aesthetically. 

### Useful resources

I used MDN as a resource. That's about it.
